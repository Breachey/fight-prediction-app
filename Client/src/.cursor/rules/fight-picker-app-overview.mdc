# Fight Picker App: Project Structure & Main Files

This project is a React-based web application for picking, voting, and viewing predictions on fight events. Below is an overview of the main files and their purposes to help you navigate the codebase efficiently.

## Main Entry Point
- [main.jsx](mdc:main.jsx): Renders the root `App` component and wraps it with React Router's `BrowserRouter`.
- [App.jsx](mdc:App.jsx): The central component that manages authentication, event selection, and renders the main sections (Fights, Leaderboard, Admin, etc.).

## Core Components
- [Fights.jsx](mdc:Fights.jsx): Displays all fights for a selected event, allows users to pick winners, submit votes, and view vote distributions. Handles local state and API interactions for predictions.
- [Leaderboard.jsx](mdc:Leaderboard.jsx): Shows both event-specific and overall leaderboards, with options to include/exclude bot votes.
- [FightVotes.jsx](mdc:FightVotes.jsx): Displays detailed vote breakdowns for a single fight, including user and AI votes.
- [VotedFights.jsx](mdc:VotedFights.jsx): Shows all fights a user has voted on, leveraging [FightVotes.jsx](mdc:FightVotes.jsx).
- [EventSelector.jsx](mdc:EventSelector.jsx): Dropdown for selecting the current event, with status badges and error handling.
- [UserAuth.jsx](mdc:UserAuth.jsx): Handles user login and registration via phone number and username.
- [components/SplashScreen.jsx](mdc:components/SplashScreen.jsx): Splash/loading screen shown during app initialization.

## Utility Functions
- [utils/countryUtils.js](mdc:utils/countryUtils.js): Provides helpers for country code mapping, height formatting, and streak formatting for fighter stats.
- [config.js](mdc:config.js): Exports the API base URL, using an environment variable or a default value.

## Styling
- [Fights.css](mdc:Fights.css): Main styles for the fight cards, voting UI, and responsive layout.
- [FightVotes.css](mdc:FightVotes.css): Styles for the vote breakdown and user/AI vote lists.
- [EventSelector.css](mdc:EventSelector.css): Styles for the event dropdown and status badges.
- [index.css](mdc:index.css): Global styles and resets for the app.
- [components/SplashScreen.css](mdc:components/SplashScreen.css): Styles for the splash/loading screen.
- [App.css](mdc:App.css): General app layout and header/footer styles.

## Assets
- [assets/](mdc:assets): Contains logos, images, and other static assets used throughout the app.

## Notes
- All API interactions use the `API_URL` from [config.js](mdc:config.js).
- Local storage is used for persisting user selections and authentication state.
- The app is fully responsive and uses modern CSS for layout and theming.

This structure should help you quickly locate the main logic, UI, and utility files in the Fight Picker app.
